- last week new results form done
- re-arranged intersect-exlusions-hab_stats -> intersect-hab_stats-exclusions
  which fixed issues with hab / length / exclusions (distance calcs not working)
- created some 'sharedsubs' so code is not so redundant
- to do: optimize analysis in R of the DCI traces


Dec 5, 2020
- Since Sep and present, working on new results form, new progress form
- major issue to resolve is exclusions which exclude 'distance' length calcs
- exclusions must change so selections are not used at all since you can't exclude and include both habitat and length, respectively
